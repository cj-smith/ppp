This is an activity to learn how to collaborate with git

The first thing you need to do is get your own copy of this repo in a way that doesn't change this repo. We can do this by forking this repo

In github, click the fork button. Then copy the url for that remote repo and clone that repo to your local computer.

If you get done with the activity and there are changes to the repo, make the changes, commit them, push them to your remote repo. THEN ask me or Al how to make a request that I take your suggested changes and implement them into my repo.
